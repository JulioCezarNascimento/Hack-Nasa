## ðŸ’» Project

Connect.ci is a social network aimed at any citizens (scientists, professionals, social actors, etc.) interested in scientific knowledge. In our MVP, the user will be able to create a profile with their basic data and areas of interest so that the system can filter this information and suggest links to projects, research/scientific articles, open codes, open data and free hardwares. There are other features still in development that best encompass the concept of social networking and complement our vision. Such as:
- Publish ideas, project updates, questions, suggestions, etc.;
- Interact (like, comment, recommend, financially support, contribute);
- Evaluators will be able to view the projects/articles/etc. recommended and receive a financial incentive to evaluate them.

The current process of scientific development is extremely slow, exclusive and bureaucratic. By creating a social network, in addition to accelerating the sharing of ideas, we transform this process into something accessible, intuitive and collaborative, implementing/rooting the culture and movement of open science.
